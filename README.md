# CS116_Final_Project
This is my final project for CS116 Object-Oriented Programming II.
It is an application that loads in a .csv file from your computer and parses it by commas, ultimately printing out your desired output in the
console. You can either add, remove, show, or see the number of IDs in the program. It can print out the database/array list that you chose to print (either all or a certain ID). You can add IDs to the arraylist, remove IDs from the arraylist, or just see how many items are in the list.
This project/class was great exposure to inheritance, arraylists, importing .csv files, error handling such as try/catching (FileNotFoundException in this case), and many other useful methods for the 2nd half of Object-Oriented Programming.
